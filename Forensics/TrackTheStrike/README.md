## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
You'll have to quickly pass the pcapng into tshark -T Fields -e usb.capdata and pipes with grep & stdout to a file. 
After that a simple python script will decrypt the data. 
Careful that I type in Azerty keyboard and most of the keycode scripts maps qwerty.

## Scenario
We just find this sniffing communication file from a investigation. Could you extract the secret inside ?
