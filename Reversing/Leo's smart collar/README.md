# Leo's smart collar

## Category
Reversing

## Estimated difficulty
Hard

## Description
The goal is to reverse an esp32 binary and discover that it is used to print a qr code, the qr code is an OTP which then can be used to retrieve the flag

## Scenario
I just made a smart collar for my maltese Leo. Leo really likes the birds and tend to run off chasing birds. As I wanted to have a way for people to reach out to me I created a super smart collar. As it seems to work quite nice for Leo, I'm thinking about manufacturing such a device. Can you review it's security before it is released?
