Because of the format of the key, 2 'rounds' of encryption are done and each round has 3 bytes of entropy (6 hexdigits). Bruteforcing 6 bytes of entropy is way too slow, but a [meet in the middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet-in-the-middle_attack) can reduce this to cracking 3 bytes of entropy twice at the cost of more memory overhead. The example solution uses just under 3GB of memory and takes ~5 minutes. Using C or C++ can significantly reduce both of these numbers.
