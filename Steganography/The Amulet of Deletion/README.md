## Category
Stego

## Estimated difficulty
Easy

## Description
A Minecraft world in which chunks have been removed in the pattern of a Micro QR Code

## Scenario
I discovered something scary in my minecraft world, it was a wierd amulet, and, when I put it on, my game crashed! I'm scared about my world being corrupt, can you check?

## Write-up
If you open the world in minecraft, the chunks will be regenerated, not showing the results.
If you open the world in Amulet, a world editor, you'll get a pattern in the shape of a Micro QR Code
